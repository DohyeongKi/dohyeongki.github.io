I am a PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by 
Aditya Guntuboyina. Previously, I received my BS in Mathematics from 
Seoul National University. 

My research focuses on developing statistical foundations for modern 
machine learning methods. I am particularly interested in understanding 
complex and greedy machine learning algorithms. I am also broadly 
interested in nonparametric statistics, especially shape-constrained 
estimation.
