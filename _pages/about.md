I am a PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by 
Aditya Guntuboyina. Previously, I received my BS in Mathematics from 
Seoul National University. 

My research focuses on understanding modern machine learning methods 
through the lens of nonparametric estimation. I am also broadly 
interested in nonparametric statistics, especially variation 
denoising/regularization and shape-constrained estimation.
