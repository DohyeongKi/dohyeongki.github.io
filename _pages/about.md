I am a PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Aditya Guntuboyina. Previously, I received my BS in Mathematics from Seoul National University. 

My research focuses on understanding machine learning methods through the lens of nonparametric estimation. Currently, I am particularly interested in tree-based methods. I also have a broad interest in nonparametric statistics, especially variation denoising and shape-constrained estimation.
